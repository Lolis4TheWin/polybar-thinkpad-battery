# polybar-thinkpad-battery
Polybar script/module that combines 2 battery and displays it. 

## What does this script does?
This script prints the average battery of your 2 batteries. Then displays the current watt usage. The "AC" tag displays that if the cabel is plugged or not. You can remove it, it is not necessary. 

## Dependencies(?)
nerdfont / awesomefonts for the icon. if you want different icon in terminal press ctrl+alt+u and then select one, this tool will automatically paste the selected icon. 

## Todo
-[] somehow make the left-click action work so it can display each battery side by side.
